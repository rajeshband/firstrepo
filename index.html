            traits that define who you are. Kind? Self-confident? Brave? Productive? These and other positive
            personality traits indeed define who we are.

            Positive character traits are what help us to thrive in whatever we do. It doesn’t matter whether it’s
            assertiveness, independence, reliability, or adaptive problem-solving manner, all these positive character
            traits help us pursue our dreams and express ourselves.

            However, we also have some negative character traits that are also part of our personality. But the most
            interesting thing about your personality is that it’s not constant.

            As you gain new experiences, your character traits change. And you are the one who chooses what kind of
            person you’d like to become. By finding out the meaning of positive qualities and taking a look at the
            examples of positive character traits, you’ll become more aware of the person you want to become.</p>
